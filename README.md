# CS4310-Memory-Management-Final-Project
Examples for OS Memory Management will have the jar files for the programs located within the Jars file. Within there will be two programs, ClockReplacement.jar and Segmentation.jar, which can both re ran. The other files contain source code within their respective files.

# Clock Replacement Usage
Java -jar ClockReplacement.jar

You will be asked to enter the number of frames and then you can sequentially enter pages from a reference string to observe how the clock replacement algorithm works.


# Segmentation Allocation
Java -jar Segmentation.jar

There will be input fields where you can enter the name of the segment, the size of it, and the choice of allocation method. The Manual allocation method will ask you for the base address of the segment. There wil also be another drop down where you can select a segment to remove, and another button where you can compact the memory segments.
